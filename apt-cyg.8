DESCRIPTION
       apt-cyg is a package management utility that tracks installed packages
       on a Cygwin system.  Invoking apt-cyg involves specifying an operation
       with any potential options and targets to operate on.  A target is
       either a package name, file name, search string, URL, or directory.
       Targets can be provided as command line arguments.

OPERATIONS
       list[all] [pkg...]
           Search for package names that match regexp.  If no package names
           are provided in the command line, all installed packages will be
           listed.  If listall is used, searches the master package list
           (setup.ini).

       show pkg...
           Display information on given package name(s).

       listfiles pkg...
           List all files owned by a given package. Multiple packages can be
           specified on the command line.

       install pkg...
           Install package(s) and any dependencies.

       source pkg...
           Retrieve package source(s) from the server into package directory
           created under current directory and unpack under the package
           directory.

       download pkg...
           Retrieve package(s) from the server, but do not install/upgrade
           anything.

       remove pkg...
           Remove package(s) from the system.

       depends pkg...
           Produce a tree of all dependencies for a package.

       rdepends pkg...
           Produce a tree of packages that depend on the named package.

       search[all] file...
           Search for packages that own the specified file(s).  The path can
           be relative or absolute, and one or more files can be specified.
           If searchall is used searches cygwin.com for packages that own the
           specified file(s).

       category [cat...]
           Display all packages that are members of a named category.  If no
           category is provided in the command line, all categories used will
           be listed.

       update
           Download a fresh copy of the master package list (setup.ini) from
           the mirror.

       mirror [URL]
           Set the mirror: a full URL to a location where the database,
           packages, and signatures for this repository can be found.  If no
           URL is provided, display the current mirror.

       cache [directory]
           Set the package cache directory.  Unix and Windows forms are
           accepted, as well as absolute or regular paths.  If no directory is
           provided, display current cache.  If a package to install is not
           found in the cache directory, it will be downloaded.

OPTIONS
       --build|--compile
           With source: install any build dependencies; if cygport is part of
           the package, include cygport and any of its build dependencies, and
           build package using cygport; otherwise try to configure, then try
           to make; if cygport is not part of the package, build dependencies
           may be missing, and need to be installed manually.

       --download|--download-only
           With source: just download and do not unpack source package.

       --nodeps
           Specify this option to skip all dependency checks, and not download
           or install packages on which specified packages are dependent.

       --nopick
           Internal option for install of a package dependency.

       --noscripts
           Specify this option to skip running any preremove or postinstall
           scripts.  Used internally during install to defer running
           postinstall scripts until all requested packages and dependencies
           have been installed.

       --help
           Display usage and exit.

       --version
           Display version and exit.

DIAGNOSTICS
       apt-cyg returns zero on normal operation, non-zero on error.
